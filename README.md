Study patterns in cognitive activity of women during menstrual cycle
Objective: 
Study the variation in Cognitive Performance in females during the menstrual cycle using EEG data.




# Estrogen levels at various phases in Menstrual Cycle.


_First day: When period starts, lowest estrogen levels_
Across a menstrual cycle of a woman there is a considerable variation in the levels of reproductive hormones - Estrogen, Progesterone, Follicle Stimulating Hormone. Of theses Estrogen and Progesterone  also play a very important role in the brain stimulation functions.
We hypothesize that due to this fluctuation in the hormone levels, women will show variation in their cognitive performance across the menstrual cycle. During the Mid Luteal phase, when the level of these hormones is maximum, women will show maximum cognitive performance. To test our hypothesis we are using EEG data collected on two subjects over the full menstrual cycle. The EEG data will be collected during the performance of similar tasks over the whole period and would be our measure for brain activity.

# Synopsis: 
In our project, we will measure the brainwaves of a subject during the performance of different predefined tasks at different phases of the menstrual cycle. The tasks will be set so as to study the changes in analytical thinking capacity, visual attention and mental relaxation of women during menstrual cycle. 
As of now, we have decided to study analytical thinking capacity and visual attention by recording brain waves when the subject is playing relevant games on lumosity (a brain training app). For mental relaxation behavior, we plan to use headspace (a meditation app).
Once we have readings from different subjects, we will then compare and explore for any trends or patterns in cognitive changes in women during the different phases of menstrual cycle.

_Important Questions to consider_: 
What influence does the variation in estrogen level have on the activation of the female brain, is the notion of period brain related to hormonal level changes?

_Motivations_:  
The result is an important step in better comprehension of certain psychiatric and neurological pathologies. 

_Experimental Design and Testing Procedure_ :
We intend to collect data for the entire menstrual cycle and study the EEG measurements recorded during the various phases. In order to do the experiment in a more controlled setting, we have decided to adhere to the following procedure. The subject is supposed to sit in front of the laptop and start the assigned task so as to be able to concentrate fully on the task and not get distracted. For the meditation task, we have observed different settings work for both of us, while for one subject switching off all screens and focussing on the breathing activity helps, the other subject would be using a meditation app and follow the instructions from the “headspace” app. We are also making a separate metadata note which contains additional information about what the subject felt at the end of the task. For example, while playing a game the first few seconds are spent in reading the rules of the game and processing them before finally playing it. Did the subject feel reading the rules was not a stimulating enough task or was it a lot of information to be provided in one go?  We believe these additional metadata information will help us while doing analysis and also help us isolate spurious patterns in the signal if any.
